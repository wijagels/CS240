	Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. And Id like to take a minute just sit right there Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air. 

	In west Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool and all shootin some bball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared! She said youre movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air. 

	I begged and pleaded with her day after day. But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.  I put my Walkman on and said I might as well kick it. First class yo this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.  Is this what the people of Bel Air living like? Hummmmm this might be alright. 

	But wait I hear theyre prissy bourgeois all that. Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I dont think so. Ill see when I get there. I hope theyre prepared for the prince of Bel Air. 

	Well the plane landed and when I came out there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out. I aint trying to get arrested yet I just got here! I sprang with the quickness like lightning disappeared. 

	I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought Nah forget it. Yo homes to Bel Air! 

	I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie Yo homes smell ya later. I looked at my kingdom I was finally there!  To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
