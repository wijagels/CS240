	Just sit right back and youll hear a tale. A tale of a fateful trip. That started from this tropic port aboard this tiny ship. The mate was a mighty sailing man. The skipper brave and sure. Five passengers set sail that day. For a three hour tour. A three hour tour. 

	The weather started getting rough. The tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew the minnow would be lost. The minnow would be lost. 

	The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle. With Gilligan. The Skipper to. The millionaire and his wife. The movie star. The professor and Mary Ann. Here on Gilligans Isle! 

	So this is the tale of the castaways. Theyre here for a long long time. Theyll have to make the best of things. Its an uphill climb. 

	The first mate and the Skipper too will do their very best to make the others comfortable in the tropic island nest. 

	No phone no lights no motor cars. Not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe as primative as can be! 

	So join us here each week my friends. Youre sure to get a smile from seven stranded castaways here on Gilligans Isle.
